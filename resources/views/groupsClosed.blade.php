    <h2 class="text-lg my-2 font-semibold text-sw-green">Booking no longer required!</h2>

    <p class="mb-2">
        Our groups are starting to slowly return to 'normal', which means you no longer need to book to attend, but we
        still have lots of measures in place to keep you safe at group.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>
            Masks aren't compulsory, but unless you are exempt we would ask that you wear a mask while
            walking round the venue and at pay and weigh, but you can take it off when you're sat in your
            seat for group.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hand Sanitizer is available is available at several points around the venue, but feel free to
            bring your own too if you like.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will still be operating a separate entry/exit door, entry will be via the rear door and the
            exit via the middle door straight onto the car park.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shoes are no longer required when you are getting weighed, and we will be able to write in your
            books again.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the shop, if possible only touch what you are planning on buying.
        </li>
        <li>
            All surfaces, and pay and weigh equipment will be cleaned between sessions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-2 font-semibold">
        Some things are changing though, and more changes will be introduced over the coming weeks!
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>
            We are removing the sneeze screens, social distance dots and one way system around the pay and
            weigh stations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our Tuesday morning and Tuesday evening groups will each combine into one 90 minute session with 30 minute
            weigh period and 60 minute IMAGE therapy group session, starting at 9:30 in the morning at 17:30 in the
            evening.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our Thursday evening groups will stay as two separate sessions at the same time, but be extended
            into 90 minute sessions with a 30 minute weigh period and 60 minute IMAGE therapy group session.
        </li>
        <li>
            New Member sessions will be at the same time as weigh at normal groups, rather than a dedicated
            session between or after sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refreshments including tea and coffee will be available from the kitchen. Please wipe down after
            use!
        </li>
        <li>
            Toilets will be back open for use during groups.
        </li>
        <li>
            Over the coming weeks we will slowly reintroduce previous group activities such as the raffle,
            slimmer of the week basket, interest table.
        </li>
        <li>
            Over the coming weeks we will start rearranging the group layout to how it was pre-covid with
            the pay and weigh stations at the opposite end of the building to where they are now, and
            introducing more seats and seats closer together.
        </li>
