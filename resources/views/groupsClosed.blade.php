    <h2 class="text-lg my-2 font-semibold text-sw-red">Physical Groups Temporally Closed</h2>

    <p>
        Unfortunately due to the current lockdown in England we've had to pause our physical Slimming World Groups at
        The Brittles, Wistaston.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rest assured though, we're still committed to supporting your weight loss journey which is why we're still
        running our <strong>Virtual Groups!</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        With our Virtual Groups you just need to weigh at home and send us your weight every week, and for that 'in
        group' experience we'll be running Image Therapy sessions from the comfort of your own home like we did in the
        previous lockdown between March and August.
    </p>

    <p>
        For those of you currently on a countdown, these will not be paused and will remain active, in buying the
        countdown you have committed to either 6 or 12 weeks of your weight loss journey and we will continue to support
        you in that journey. Any weeks not used will unfortunately be lost.
    </p>

    <p>
        For more information please get in touch, and hopefully we'll be back in physical groups in December!
    </p>
